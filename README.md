# Guess-Guess-Game
This project is a simple number guessing game where the program generates a random number, and the user attempts to guess it. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and it tracks the number of attempts, displaying the total when the correct number is guessed

In this Project I used  two approaches first is using while loop and no limit of attempts for guess the value but in the second approach I used for loop for maximum attempts for guess the value
